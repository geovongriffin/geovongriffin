I'm Geo! A developer & designer from the US. Nice to meet you.

I work as the Information Services lead for a [public library](https://demarestlibrary.org/about/our-team). My next career goal is to work full-time in the gaming industry, or something close to it / adjacent!

#### ðŸŒ± What I'm working on
- Experimenting with different tech stacks on my [portfolio](https://geovongriffin.com/) space
- Laying the groundwork for my dream micro-blogging platform, "mydijo.com"
    - dijo = digital journal
    - Inspired by platforms like Tumblr and Twitter
    - Will be FLOSS with the source code available on GitHub
- Building a few mini-projects using: GameMaker Studio 2, Godot 4.5, Pixelorama, Bitwig Studio

#### ðŸª€ Apps I like to use
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
- [Pixelorama](https://godotengine.org/showcase/pixelorama/)
- [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/)
- [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

I'll begin looking for dev work in 2026. I'm currently taking a dev course in my off-hours and will be graduating in March. I appreciate you checking out my page in the meantime. Come back later!
