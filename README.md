## About
Hey, I'm Geo - a web developer + designer from the US. Right now I have a 9-5, but my end goal is to work full-time for myself!

### ðŸŒ± What I'm working on
- Building my [portfolio](https://geovongriffin.com/) space
- Laying the groundwork for my dream micro-blogging platform: _mydijo.com_
- My current skillsets include:
    * HTML5 : Advanced
    * CSS3 : Advanced
    * UX/UI Design: Proficient
    * Pixel Art: Proficient

    _On the list to learn: Javascript, React, PHP..._

## Right now
I'm not looking for work in this field right now, but that will change in 2026. I'm currently taking a full-stack dev course and will be graduating in March. I appreciate you checking out my page in the meantime. Come back later!
